# Testable Components

Learning to create React component that can be tested automatically

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have installed all of prerequisites:
  * Node.js 10
  * Git
  * Yarn or npm (Yarn is recommended)
2. Clone this repo
3. `yarn install`
4. Done

Local server can be started using `yarn start`. Initially it will failed because it can't find `Login.js`. We will create `Login.js` in this learning session.

To test, run `yarn test`. Initially there is no test yet so Jest will tell you "no test found".
